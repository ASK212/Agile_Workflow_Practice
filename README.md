# The article:
[IBM: What is Software Development](https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-development)

## Why this article / What's interesting about this article?
I came across this article, simply searching for the most relevant article I could find to software development.
While I originally intended to find a more "interesting" article, this one intrigued me since it was not what I first thought of when I thought of software development.
When I think about software development, the first thing that comes to my mind is programming and programming languages.
However, the article focuses much more on the software development methodology, the steps involved, and the steps to creating and deploying software.

It is especially interesting to consider software development from the viewpoint of this article, which I feel closely follows that of our class,
since much of software development and its methodologies are very new relative to the life of coding and programming.
The article leaves me asking the question, what would the definition of software development look like 30 years ago, without the relatively new methodologies in place.
